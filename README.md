This sunshine fork was modified to run on Maximum Settings cloud gaming instances.
It needs to be placed in specific folders.

The sunshine build (.exe) needs to be placed in;
C:\Users\MaximumSettings\Services

The pin verification tool must be placed in;
C:\Users\MaximumSettings\Services\moonlightpinverification

Make sure the .exe is named; MoonlightPinVerification.exe .

All apps (including the control panel) MUST have ADMINISTRATOR rights to run correctly!


Security Note;

The pin verfification system passes the pin through to the webserver in order to submit the pin.  

This could be a security risk if the webserver is NOT blocked by your windows firewall.

Please ensure that only the local host can access the webserver.
